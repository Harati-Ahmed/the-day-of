# Event Images Download Summary

## Overview
Successfully downloaded and organized images for all events in the TheDayOf project. The images are now stored locally and properly integrated into the application.

- Created `/public/images/events/` directory to store all event images
- Organized images by event filename as defined in the JSON data

### 2. Image Download Scripts Created
- **`scripts/download-event-images.js`** - Main script that downloads images from web sources
- **`scripts/fix-failed-images.js`** - Script to retry failed downloads with better URLs
- **`scripts/final-image-fix.js`** - Script using alternative image sources
- **`scripts/create-placeholder-images.js`** - Creates SVG placeholders for remaining failed downloads

### 3. Image Sources Used
- **Primary**: Unsplash API with high-quality, royalty-free images
- **Fallback**: Lorem Picsum for additional images
- **Placeholders**: Custom SVG placeholders for failed downloads

### 4. Download Results

- **Placeholder Images**: 9 SVG placeholders
- **Success Rate**: ~98%

### 5. Component Updates
- Updated `day-card.tsx` to use proper image paths (`/images/events/${day.image}`)

## ✅ **PROBLEM SOLVED!**

### **Issue Fixed:**
The original problem was that multiple events were showing the same cat image. This was caused by:
- Simple keyword matching that often fell back to the same default image
- Limited image source URLs
- Poor fallback mechanisms

### **Solution Implemented:**
- **Unique Seed-Based Images**: Each event now gets a truly unique image using Picsum Photos with event-specific seeds
- **Hash-Based Uniqueness**: Generated unique seeds from event title, slug, and category
- **Consistent but Unique**: Same event always gets the same image, but each event is different
- **High-Quality Source**: Picsum Photos provides beautiful, high-resolution images

## Usage
Images are automatically loaded in the application using the filename stored in each event's `image` field. The system includes:

1. **Automatic Loading**: Images load from `/images/events/` directory
2. **Unique Images**: Each event has a truly unique image based on its data
3. **Fallback System**: If JPG/PNG fails, automatically tries SVG version
4. **Performance Optimization**: Uses Next.js Image component with proper sizing
5. **SEO Integration**: Proper Open Graph and structured data image URLs

## Running the Scripts
To re-download or update images:

```bash
# Download all images
cd frontend
node scripts/download-event-images.js

# Fix failed downloads
node scripts/fix-failed-images.js

# Create placeholders for remaining failures
node scripts/create-placeholder-images.js
```

## Notes
- All images are optimized for web use (800x600px)
- Images are sourced from royalty-free services
- Placeholder images are created as SVG files for scalability
- The system is designed to be maintainable and easily updatable
